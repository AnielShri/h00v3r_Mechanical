# Discussion

* 123-3d.nl is relatively more expensive and does not has custom sizes, so it will not be considered.
* aluxprofiel.nl only has the 2020 profiles, but not the linear axis or its accesoires. Shipping costs are either [€6.99 or €12.99](https://www.aluxprofiel.nl/over-ons/verzendkosten), depending on the mass. A final price comparison to follow.
* motedis.nl seems to be the cheapest, and has the full catalog of required items. This seems like the best contender.
* uk.misumi-ec.com at firce glance seems reasonable, but a 200mm frame of type 2020 costs €3.34, which makes it more expensive than the rest.
